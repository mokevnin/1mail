# Go test harness

`internal/testhelper.Setup(t)` is the standard fixture. It migrates schema + loads
committed YAML fixtures from `fixtures/` **once per process**, then each test runs inside
a **go-txdb** transaction that rolls back on cleanup (full isolation, DB stays at fixture
state). Tests drive the real server in-memory through **actors** (typed ogen clients, see
below) — no sockets. See `internal/api/site/contacts_test.go`.

**Build test scenarios on the committed fixtures — don't fabricate the primary
entities inline.** Reference fixture rows through the catalog constants below
(`fixtures.BroadcastDraftID`, `fixtures.ContactAliceID`, `fixtures.SegmentActiveID`, …),
never bare id literals (a deliberately missing id such as `999999` is fine). Query counts
that vary with the dataset dynamically instead of hardcoding them. If a
scenario isn't covered, **add a fixture row** rather than a `client.X.Create()` in the
test. Anchor rows flagged "DO NOT change" in the YAML are referenced across the suite —
leave them. txdb rolls back each test, so mutating a fixture row inside a test is fine.
Exception: incidental one-off records (e.g. a suppression to trip a specific edge) may be
created inline when no fixture expresses them.

## Fixture catalog

Anchor fixture rows have **named constants** in `internal/fixtures/catalog_gen.go`
(generated; never hand-edit). Reference `fixtures.AcmeID`, `fixtures.ContactAliceEmail`,
`fixtures.AcmeCollectKey`, … instead of bare id/slug/email/key literals, so renaming or
removing an annotated row is a compile error and renumbering is absorbed by regeneration.

To add a name, put a line comment on the row's first line in `fixtures/*.yml` and run
`mise run generate`:

```yaml
- id: 1 # fixture: Acme
```

The generator (`cmd/fixturegen`, package `internal/fixtures/fixturegen`) reads the raw
files, so every template expression in fixtures must stay quoted (`'{{daysAgo 1}}'`).
It emits `<Name>ID` plus one constant per catalogued column the row carries (the
list is `catalogColumns` in `internal/fixtures/fixturegen/fixturegen.go`); unannotated
rows get nothing. It fails on a duplicate name or an annotation that matches no row.

### Credentials and anchor identities

Anchor credentials state their plaintext in the fixture and are hashed at load time by
the `argonHash` (user passwords, PHC argon2id) and `bcryptHash` (API token secrets)
template funcs, both at minimum cost (production verify code reads the cost from the
stored hash). The generator lifts the quoted literal into `<Name>Password` /
`<Name>Secret`, so `fixtures.OwnerJohnPassword`, `fixtures.AnchorTokenSecret` etc. can
authenticate as that identity; the full token is
`credentials.TokenValue(fixtures.AnchorTokenPrefix, fixtures.AnchorTokenSecret)`. Use them
only on annotated anchor rows, not dev tokens. The test values are plain constants in the
generated file; gitleaks needs no allowlist for them.

Anchor tenancy rows: Acme (owner `OwnerJohn`, member `MemberMary`), a second tenant
`Globex` (owner `OwnerJane`, membership `GlobexOwnerMembership`), and `OutsiderOscar`
with no membership. A test must not assume Acme has a single member or that only one
Workspace exists.

## Actors

An **actor** is a ready typed client for one API surface acting as one identity. Ask the
`TestEnv` for it; JWT signing, token generation and hashing (through the production token
code), security sources and the in-memory transport stay inside
`internal/testhelper/actor.go`. Tests never touch JWTs, headers or transports.

| Surface  | Identity                         | Call                                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| site     | fixture user                     | `env.SiteActor(t, fixtures.OwnerJohnEmail)`                 |
| site     | anonymous                        | `env.SiteAnonymous(t)`                                      |
| external | anchor token                     | `env.ExternalAnchor(t)`                                     |
| external | Acme token with exactly `scopes` | `env.ExternalScoped(t, "contacts:read")`                    |
| external | anonymous / raw bad credential   | `env.ExternalAnonymous(t)`, `env.ExternalWithToken(t, raw)` |
| collect  | Acme collect key                 | `env.CollectAcme(t)`                                        |
| collect  | anonymous / raw bad key          | `env.CollectAnonymous(t)`, `env.CollectWithKey(t, raw)`     |

Clients are the generated ogen clients (`siteapi.Client`, `externalapi.Client`,
`collectapi.Client`). JWT expiry comes from the helper's single `now()`, so a clock seam
can be injected there later. Do not mint JWTs, hash tokens, or build security sources or
clients in a test: ask the env for an actor. For a raw bearer (raw HTTP or MCP) use
`env.ScopedBearer(t, scopes...)`, or `env.ScopedBearerFor(t, fixtures.GlobexID, scopes...)`
for another tenant. Such helpers may persist a token with explicit scopes, but only
through the production hash/generate functions.
`env.MCPClient(t, bearer)` connects an MCP session.

Tenant-isolation tests use the committed Globex rows by name (`fixtures.SegmentGlobexID`,
`fixtures.TemplateGlobexName`, …). The admin role has no fixture user (a committed admin
would change the exact Acme member list), so a role test that needs one creates it inline;
owner and member are `OwnerJohn` and `MemberMary`.
