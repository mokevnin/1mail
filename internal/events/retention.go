// PruneEvents deletes analytical Events created more than retention ago, in
// batches of batchSize, and returns how many it removed. Age is created_at (the
// insert time), not occurred_at: created_at is never null and is what the table's
// growth follows; an Event backfilled with an old occurred_at is kept until its
// row itself ages out. A retention of zero or less disables the prune. The job is
// idempotent: a rerun finds nothing left to delete.
