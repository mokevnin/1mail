# Self-hosting 1mail

1mail ships as a **single self-contained artifact** — one Go binary (or one Docker image)
with the React SPA, the tracker snippet (`/t.js`), and the database migrations all
embedded. The only external dependency at runtime is **PostgreSQL** (the background queue
and pub/sub both ride on Postgres — no Redis, no object storage, no separate worker).

- **PostgreSQL:** 14+ recommended.
- Outbound email via SMTP or any SES-compatible service (Amazon SES, Yandex Cloud Postbox and others).

## Configuration

Configuration is read from environment variables (and, if present, `.env` files next to
the binary). `APP_ENV` selects the environment (`development` by default; set it to
`production` when self-hosting — the published Docker images already default to `production`).

| Variable                                                            | Required        | Default                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Use `sslmode=verify-full` (with `sslrootcert`) to also verify the server certificate.                                                                                                                                      |

Outside `development`/`test` the server refuses to boot if it is empty, shorter than 32 characters, or a known placeholder. Generate one with `openssl rand -hex 32`.                                                                                                          |

## Generate the keys

Both secrets are random values you create once and keep:

```sh
openssl rand -hex 32          # JWT_SECRET
docker run --rm ghcr.io/mokevnin/1mail:latest genkey   # ENCRYPTION_KEY (or: ./1mail genkey)
```

Back up `ENCRYPTION_KEY` with your database. It encrypts the stored SMTP and SES-compatible credentials, and
without it they cannot be read again. Changing `JWT_SECRET` only signs everyone out.

## Database migrations

Migrations are embedded in the binary. You apply them one of two ways:

- **Single replica:** set `AUTO_MIGRATE=true` and the binary migrates on startup.
- **Multiple replicas:** do **not** use `AUTO_MIGRATE` (replicas would race). Run the
  migration step once before rolling out the new version:

  ```sh
  ./1mail migrate      # applies pending migrations and exits
  ```

  Use it as a pre-deploy job or a Kubernetes init container, then start the servers
  without `AUTO_MIGRATE`.

Before upgrading, take a database backup; see [Upgrading](./operations/upgrading) for the
full procedure and [Backup and restore](./operations/backup) for what to protect.

> The binary tracks applied migrations (via goose) in its own `goose_db_version` table. Don't point
> it at a database previously managed by the Atlas dev-CLI flow (which uses
> `atlas_schema_revisions`).

## Run it

### Docker

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e APP_ENV=production \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@db:5432/1mail?sslmode=require" \
  -e JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY="<base64 tink keyset>" \
  -e APP_URL="https://mail.example.com" \
  -e AUTO_MIGRATE=true \
  ghcr.io/mokevnin/1mail:latest
```

The image declares a `HEALTHCHECK` against `/healthz`, so `docker ps` reports `healthy`
once the process is serving.

### Binary

```sh
export APP_ENV=production
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@host:5432/1mail?sslmode=require"
export JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
export ENCRYPTION_KEY="<base64 tink keyset>"
export APP_URL="https://mail.example.com"

./1mail migrate   # apply migrations (or set AUTO_MIGRATE=true)
./1mail           # start the server
```

### systemd

For the bare binary, a unit keeps it running and restarts it on failure. Put the environment in a
file only root can read:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/1mail.service
[Unit]
Description=1mail
After=network-online.target postgresql.service
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
User=onemail
EnvironmentFile=/etc/1mail/env
ExecStartPre=/usr/local/bin/1mail migrate
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/1mail
Restart=on-failure
NoNewPrivileges=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```sh
sudo install -m 600 -o root /dev/null /etc/1mail/env   # then add KEY=value lines
sudo systemctl enable --now 1mail
```

`ExecStartPre` runs the migrations before every start, so leave `AUTO_MIGRATE` unset.

## HTTPS and reverse proxy

1mail speaks plain HTTP on `PORT`. Put a reverse proxy in front for TLS, and set `APP_URL` to the
public `https://` origin: tracking pixels, click links, unsubscribe links and OAuth metadata are
built from it, so a wrong value breaks mail already sent.

Caddy gets and renews certificates by itself:

```caddyfile
mail.example.com {
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3000
}
```

nginx:

```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name mail.example.com;
  # ssl_certificate / ssl_certificate_key ...

  client_max_body_size 1m;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  }
}
```

Do not expose `METRICS_ADDR` through the proxy.

The external API can also live on its own host, such as `api.example.com`, if the proxy rewrites
`/*` to `/api/*` (`rewrite ^/(.*)$ /api/$1 break;` in nginx, `rewrite * /api{uri}` in Caddy). The
binary itself stays path-based.

## Backups and upgrades

All state is in PostgreSQL, so a backup is a database backup plus your `ENCRYPTION_KEY`:

```sh
pg_dump --format=custom --file=1mail-$(date +%F).dump "$DATABASE_URL"
```

To upgrade, back up, then pull the new image (or replace the binary) and restart. Migrations are
applied as described [above](#database-migrations). Pin a version tag rather than `latest` in
production, and read the release notes before a major version. Migrations only move forward, so
to roll back restore the backup taken before the upgrade.

## Kubernetes

There is no Helm chart yet. The image is a plain stateless container, so a Deployment needs only
the environment above, `/healthz` as the liveness probe and `/readyz` as the readiness probe.
Run `1mail migrate` as a pre-deploy Job or init container and keep `AUTO_MIGRATE` unset when you
run more than one replica.

## Health checks

| Endpoint       | Purpose   | Behaviour                                                                               |
| -------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /healthz` | Liveness  | Always `200 {"status":"ok"}` while the process serves; touches no dependency.           |
| `GET /readyz`  | Readiness | Pings the database; `200` when reachable, `503` (`application/problem+json`) otherwise. |

Wire `/healthz` to liveness and `/readyz` to readiness probes (Kubernetes, load
balancers, the Docker `HEALTHCHECK`).

## Prometheus metrics

Metrics are off by default and are never served on the public port. Set `METRICS_ADDR` to
start a dedicated listener that serves `GET /metrics` (Prometheus exposition) and nothing
else. There is no token and no allowlist: the network boundary is the control (ADR 0018).

- Single host: `METRICS_ADDR=127.0.0.1:9090` so only local scrapers can reach it.
- Container: `METRICS_ADDR=0.0.0.0:9090`, and publish that port only to your Prometheus
  (a network policy or an internal network), never through the public ingress. An empty host (`:9090`) binds every interface, like
  the container form.

A `METRICS_ADDR` using the same port as `PORT`, or a malformed value, fails startup, as does
a metrics address that is already in use. The Dockerfiles need no change (`EXPOSE 3000` and
the `HEALTHCHECK` stay). Scrape example:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 1mail
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['1mail:9090']
```

OTLP push (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*`) is independent of this and unchanged.
