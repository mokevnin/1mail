# MCP for agents

1mail serves a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) endpoint at `/mcp`, so an
AI agent (Claude, or any MCP client) can operate a workspace: read contacts, draft broadcasts,
build segments, author automations. It is the same binary and the same data as `/api`.

The tools are **projected from the external API contract**, not written by hand. Every operation
in the [API reference](/api/) is a tool, named after its operation id in snake_case
(`Contacts_list` becomes `contacts_list`). Token scopes, workspace scoping, validation and error
bodies are the `/api` ones.

## Connect

The endpoint speaks Streamable HTTP and is stateless. Create an API token under
**Settings → API keys** (see [scopes](/guide/api#tokens-and-scopes)), then point your client at
`https://1mail.example.com/mcp` with the token as a Bearer credential.

Claude Code:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http 1mail https://1mail.example.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $ONEMAIL_TOKEN"
```

Any client that takes a JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "1mail": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://1mail.example.com/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <token>" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Connectors that sign in (OAuth)

Clients that cannot hold a static header, such as claude.ai custom connectors, use OAuth 2.1:
add `https://1mail.example.com/mcp` as the connector URL and approve the consent screen in the
1mail app. 1mail serves the discovery metadata (RFC 9728 and RFC 8414), dynamic client
registration and PKCE (S256 only).

- Only a workspace **owner or admin** can approve, because approval mints a token.
- The result is an ordinary API token named `<client> (MCP)`. It has no refresh token and does
  not expire. List and revoke it in the workspace settings like any other token.
- The consent screen lets you opt in to the send-class scopes. Token management scopes
  (`tokens:*`) can never be granted to a connector.

## What an agent can do

| Reference and rates | `custom_fields_list`, `sending_domains_list`, `sending_domains_rates`                  |
| Consent             | `unsubscribes_create`, `suppressions_create`                                           |

API token management is never a tool. The live list for your token is whatever `tools/list`
returns; it depends on the token's scopes.

## Safety model

- **Authoring, not sending, by default.** Broadcasts and automations are created as drafts.
  The send-class tools (`emails_send`, `broadcasts_schedule`, `broadcasts_unschedule`,
  `automations_activate`) need their own API scope (`emails:send`, `broadcasts:send`,
  `automations:activate`) **and** the extra `mcp:send` scope on the token. Without `mcp:send`
  they are not even listed.
- **Consent only narrows.** An agent can suppress an address or record an unsubscribe. Resubscribing
  and lifting a suppression are not available over `/api` or MCP at all.
- **Contact text is data.** Contact names, custom field keys and values, event properties and tag
  names come from outside the workspace. In tool results they are wrapped as
  `{"untrusted_data": …}`, and the server instructions tell the model to treat them as data and
  never as instructions.

## Playbooks

The server also publishes MCP prompts that walk an agent through common jobs, always leaving the
final send to a human:

- **welcome**: draft a welcome automation for new contacts.
- **win-back**: draft a broadcast for contacts who went quiet.
- **list-hygiene**: audit audience health and propose cleanup.
