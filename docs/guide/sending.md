# Sending email

1mail has three send surfaces. They differ in who triggers them, and they share templates,
sending domains and consent rules.

## Templates

Templates are written in [MJML](https://mjml.io/), so responsive email works across clients, and
are compiled when the message is sent. Subjects and bodies support [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)
(conditionals and filters). Merge tags come from the contact: `{{ email }}`, `{{ first_name }}`,
`{{ last_name }}` and any of its custom fields; transactional calls can add their own variables.
Tracking (an open pixel, click rewriting and the unsubscribe footer) is layered on after
rendering, and a plain-text part is generated for you.

For marketing sends the template content is **copied** into the broadcast or automation step when
you author it, so editing a template later never rewrites mail that is already queued.
Transactional sends do the opposite and bind the template **by reference**, so your app can
update its receipt wording without a deploy.

## Broadcasts

A broadcast is one email to a segment.

1. Set a name, sender, subject and body.
2. Choose the audience segment.
3. Send a test to yourself.
4. Send it now, or schedule it. A scheduled broadcast can be unscheduled again.

A broadcast moves through `draft`, `scheduled`, `sending`, `sent` or `failed`. Its report lists
sent, opened, clicked and unsubscribed counts. Sending runs on a durable job queue backed by
PostgreSQL, so a restart does not lose work.

## Automations

An automation starts when a contact does something and then runs an ordered list of steps.

| Step         | What it does                                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `email`      | Send a message with its own subject and MJML body.  |
| `wait`       | Pause for a number of seconds before the next step. |
| `apply_tag`  | Add a tag to the enrolled contact.                  |
| `remove_tag` | Remove a tag from the enrolled contact.             |

The trigger is an event action, such as `signed_up`. A contact is enrolled once. Automations are
created as drafts and have to be activated. Each automation is its own unsubscribe scope, so
leaving one sequence does not silence the others.

## Transactional email

Your application sends a single email to one address with `POST /api/emails`, naming a template
and the variables to fill it with:

```sh
curl https://1mail.example.com/api/emails \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ONEMAIL_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "templateId": 12,
    "destination": "ada@example.com",
    "variables": { "reset_url": "https://app.example.com/reset?token=..." }
  }'
```

The token needs the `emails:send` scope. Transactional mail skips marketing unsubscribes, since
nobody can opt out of their own password reset, but it still respects the suppression list: an
address that hard-bounced or complained is never mailed. A suppressed destination returns the
status `suppressed`.

## Transports

Add one or more integrations in **Settings → Integrations**:

- **SMTP**: any server that accepts SMTP.
- **Amazon SES**: send through SES. Bounce and complaint notifications delivered over SNS are
  ingested and turned into suppressions.

Credentials are encrypted at rest. Because DKIM signing happens in 1mail itself, switching
transport does not mean re-verifying your domain.
