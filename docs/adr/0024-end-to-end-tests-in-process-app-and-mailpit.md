# End-to-end tests: in-process application, Mailpit, driven through the public API

Handler tests drive handlers through an in-memory recorder, inside a rolled-back transaction, with mail captured in
memory. Nothing exercises the real chain: HTTP API, event bus, job queue, MIME build, SMTP delivery, the message a
recipient gets and the link they follow. We add a black-box end-to-end suite that boots the whole application,
sends through a real SMTP server and observes the result only in that server's inbox.

## Decisions

- **One seam: the public HTTP API (`/api`, `/collect`) in, a Mailpit inbox out.** Tests never read the database, the
  event outbox or an in-memory sender.
- **The application runs in the test process**, with the real event router, job queue and HTTP server, started on a
  caller-provided listener so the public URL (the base of unsubscribe, confirm and tracking links) is the test
  server's own address. In-process beats driving the compiled binary: it is faster, debuggable, and reuses
  the application's own lifecycle, the same one the binary uses. Binary and reverse-proxy routing are
  left to a separate smoke test.
- **Lifecycle: `App.Start` brings everything up, `App.Close` takes everything down.** `Start(ctx)` returns without
  blocking once the metrics listener, the event router and the job workers run and the public server is serving; an
  App starts once (a second `Start` returns `ErrAlreadyStarted`). A `Start` that fails partway unwinds what it had
  started, so nothing is left running. `Close(ctx)` cancels the router and the workers, waits for both to stop (also
  after a partial failure to start the workers), shuts the HTTP servers down and then the container; it is
  idempotent and returns the first call's result. `Done()` delivers, once, how the public server ended: an error if
  serving failed, nil after a graceful `Close`.
- **A dedicated database, rebuilt on every run, and a fresh Workspace per test.** The per-test transaction rollback
  used elsewhere (go-txdb) cannot work here: the job queue and bus workers use their own connections and would never
  see uncommitted rows. Everything is Workspace-scoped (ADR 0017), so tests need no cleanup and may run in parallel.
- **Mailpit is started by the suite on free ports**, not shared with the dev stack, so the suite never collides with a
  running `mise run dev` and needs no Docker. Mailpit's own API is read through a thin typed helper: it publishes
  only Swagger 2.0, which the project's OpenAPI generator does not accept. The helper sits behind each Workspace's
  Inbox, so scenarios never call it.
- **Mail is observed only through the Workspace's Inbox.** A `Match` selects mail by exact recipient (compared
  case-insensitively; Mailpit's own search is a substring match, so the Inbox insists on the whole address) and,
  optionally, an exact subject. The Inbox offers one wait, `Wait(Match)`, polled up to a bounded timeout, which on a
  miss fails with what the inbox held instead, and one absence check, `RequireNone(Match)`, which watches for a short
  window. An absence check cannot be awaited, so a scenario first waits for a sibling delivery of the same send, which
  proves the pipeline has caught up. A failing Mailpit request fails the test; it is never read as absence. Every
  message the Inbox observed, by a wait or by an absence check that found a match, is deleted when the test ends, and
  only those, so parallel tests sharing one Mailpit stay independent. A recipient unique to the test keeps matches
  from colliding.
- **Only the arrange step is outside the API:** creating the User, Workspace and first API token with the product's
  own domain functions. Everything else is an API call. The bootstrap token is not used; it addresses only the
  oldest Workspace.
- **Sending domain verification uses a harness-only DNS lookup.** The send path requires a live DKIM check
  (ADR 0010); the suite injects the existing development lookup, which echoes a domain's own stored key, through an
  e2e-only app option (`app.WithE2EDKIMLookup`, refused outside the e2e profile) rather than the development flag. Because that lookup resolves by domain name alone
  while uniqueness is per (Workspace, domain), every test uses a unique Sending domain.
- **Asynchronous steps are polled with a bounded timeout.** The job queue clock is not controlled, Automation wait
  steps are not used and Deferral (ADR 0023) is out of scope.
- **The external API gains what the scenarios need** (Integration and Sending domain), because the API is meant to
  expose every capability and the MCP surface is a projection of it (ADR 0016). Only what the scenarios require is
  added; the rest of the parity gap is tracked separately.
- **Scenarios are written as domain steps** (import contacts, send a Broadcast, wait for an email), with the
  transport inside the harness. An MCP-driven run can then replay the same scenarios on a second transport. No
  common driver interface is introduced until that second implementation exists.
- **The suite is its own package behind a build tag, with its own task and CI job.** The default test task does not
  run it.

## Exception to "tests build on committed fixtures"

Tests normally start from committed YAML fixtures. End-to-end tests deliberately create their own User, Workspace
and data through the API, because fixtures rely on the transaction rollback that this suite cannot use. The
exception covers the end-to-end package only; every other test keeps the fixtures rule.

## Considered options

- **Compiled binary behind the reverse proxy:** truest to production, but slow, hard to debug and unable to choose
  its own public URL. Kept for a separate smoke test.
- **Shared Mailpit daemon from the dev stack:** simpler, but collides with a running dev stack and shares one inbox.
- **testcontainers:** adds a Docker dependency the toolchain otherwise avoids.
- **Provisioning through the site API with a cookie login:** needs a login flow the suite does not otherwise test and
  hides the missing external resources instead of fixing them.
