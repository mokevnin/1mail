# GDPR erasure and subject-access export: delete is erasure, Events are the one append-only exception

Workspaces sending to the EU need Art. 17 erasure and Art. 15/20 export. Competitors split (Mailchimp
anonymizes reports, Klaviyo keeps a contact-info record, Customer.io suppresses hashed identifiers,
Segment propagates asynchronously); we pick the smallest mechanism consistent with ADR 0001 and the
Event model. Both are **AGPL core** (table-stakes for EU senders); retention policies (auto-purge,
data residency) are a separate backlog item. Age-based Event pruning is already core (ADR 0019); this ADR
adds the per-person path that ADR 0019's "evidentiary Events are never deleted" must yield to.

## Decisions

- **Delete is erasure.** One primitive, no soft variant that keeps PII. Single Contact only;
  accepts a contact id or an email, or a `visitor_id` for an anonymous Visitor with no Contact.
  Operator action (the Workspace is the controller): Site UI (owner/admin only, enforceable in core
  through `scopedWithRoleFor`) and External API with a new `contacts:erase` scope, separate from
  `contacts:write`; MCP inherits it (ADR 0016). This replaces the existing CRUD contact DELETE
  (and its `contacts:write` scope); there is no second delete path.
- **Events: the one exception to append-only, and to ADR 0019's "evidentiary Events are kept".**
  Customer-tracked Events of the Contact are deleted. Every reserved system Event is anonymized in
  place (`contact_id`, `visitor_id`, `email`, `phone`, `subject_id` and `properties` cleared, except the two non-personal keys the rates are computed
  from, `sendingDomain` and `bounceKind`, which are kept): the
  `email.*` family (`sent`, `opened`, `clicked`, `bounced`, `complained`, `unsubscribed`) so
  complaint/bounce rates (ADR 0011) and metering (ADR 0009) are unchanged, and `contact.created`.
  `marketing.confirmed` is deleted, not anonymized: it is consent proof for a person who is gone and
  carries IP and provenance. Suppression and Unsubscribe do not depend on the Events (ADR 0019), so
  the refusal stays honored. Events are found by `contact_id` and by the Contact's visitor ids
  (Identify stitches earlier anonymous Events onto the Contact, so `contact_id` already covers them).
- **What survives:** `Unsubscribe` and `Suppression` rows keep their plaintext `destination`
  (ADR 0001), `contact_id` cleared. `Confirmation` is deleted (fails safe: re-confirmation).
  `OutboundMessage` / `BroadcastRecipient` lose their destination and `contact_id`; for a destination
  with no Contact (a transactional send), erasure by email anonymizes `OutboundMessage` rows by
  destination. Visitors, tags, field values and
  `AutomationRun`s are deleted. Domain-event outbox rows and river job args for the Contact are
  cleared; application logs carry no email/phone; backups are not rewritten (they age out; the
  rotation window is documented and a restore re-applies erasures).
- **Synchronous, one transaction**, which also cancels in-flight work: active runs and unsent
  broadcast recipients of the Contact are removed, and send workers re-check the Contact exists.
  A message already handed to the provider is not recalled.
- **Proof without PII:** an immutable system Event `contact.erased` (Workspace, time, operator,
  identifier kind; stored with no email and no contact id) is the accountability record. Its
  webhook delivery additionally carries the Contact's `subject_id` (the customer's own id), or the
  sphericon contact id when there was none, so the customer can erase downstream copies; the
  identifier lives only in the delivered payload, never on the stored Event. No direct downstream
  integrations. In EE the Audit log additionally records the operator's delete.
- **Not blocked on re-creation.** A returning person (Identify, import) becomes a new Contact;
  eligibility still refuses mail through the surviving opt-outs. A tombstone would itself be PII.
- **Export:** one Contact, streamed JSON download, no job and no file storage. Contents: Contact,
  Custom fields, Tags, Visitors, Events, Unsubscribe/Suppression/Confirmation for its Destinations,
  `OutboundMessage` and `BroadcastRecipient` metadata; no rendered bodies. Readable by anyone with
  contact read access. The document is a typed model in the contract (`ContactExportDocument` and
  its members, declared once in `typespec/common/contact-export.tsp`), not the stored rows: each
  member is a goverter projection of its entity, so the ent JSON tags are never the public format.
  ogen can only stream an `io.Reader` for a binary body, so the download is declared as
  `application/octet-stream` and the same operation lists the `application/json` document variant
  for typed clients; the server always streams the first, encoding each typed member as it reads
  keyset pages. A test checks that every stored column of a member has a DTO field or is named as
  deliberately left out, because goverter cannot notice a withheld column.

## Considered options

- **Hashing retained destinations** (Customer.io): rejected. Unsalted email hashes are reversible
  by guessing, so it is pseudonymization only, and it complicates the send-path lookup.
- **Blocking re-creation** (Customer.io, Mailchimp): rejected, see above.
- **Async regulations with status** (Segment): rejected until a real contact's volume demands it.
- **Mutating Events only by hard delete** (no `email.*` anonymization): rejected, it would move
  deliverability and billing numbers after every request.
