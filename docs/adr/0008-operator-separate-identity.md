# Platform Operator is a separate identity, not a User

The platform needs staff who act *across* all Workspaces (suspend an abusive sender,
impersonate for support). This collides with the model's founding invariant: every domain
entity is workspace-scoped and every query is scoped by a Workspace, reached through
`User → Membership(Role) → Workspace`. A global actor is exactly the thing that invariant
exists to forbid.

We model the **Operator** as a **distinct identity** — its own store, its own auth surface
(a fourth API surface alongside `/site`, `/api`, `/collect`), holding **no** Membership — so
workspace-scoped code has *no path* that can ever return a global actor. The invariant stays
enforceable by construction rather than by discipline. A person who is both staff and a
customer holds two separate identities, by design, for least-privilege and clean audit.

## Considered options

- **A global platform role/flag on User** (rejected): one login, but it bakes a
  workspace-scope exception into the core identity type — every scoped query path must then
  remember the global case exists, and forgetting it leaks cross-tenant.
- **A "platform" pseudo-workspace whose members are Operators** (rejected): reuses Membership
  machinery but overloads Workspace with a non-tenant meaning — the same fused-concept leak
  the project rejects elsewhere (see the List anti-pattern).

## Consequences

- The Operator, its auth surface, and the console are **EE/SaaS** (see ADR-0007); a plain
  self-hosted install has no Operator concept and flips suspension via the core CLI.
- Impersonation (a global Operator minting a temporary *scoped* workspace session) is the one
  place these two worlds must touch; it is deferred until support load demands it, so that
  bridge is designed against a real need rather than speculatively.
