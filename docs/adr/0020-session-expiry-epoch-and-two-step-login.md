# Enforced session expiry, session epoch and two-step login on go-pkgz

Site sessions are stateless JWT cookies. go-pkgz's `Parse` ignores an expired `exp` (it expects its
own middleware to refresh), and the site security handler only calls `Parse`, so the 1h token TTL
was never enforced: a stolen cookie stayed valid until the signing secret changed. We keep go-pkgz
for what it does well (JWT and cookie issuance, `ClaimsUpd`) and add: (1) `exp` enforced in the
site security handler, with one `SESSION_TTL` (default 24h) for token and cookie and no refresh;
(2) a `session_epoch` on the User, written into the token by go-pkgz's `ClaimsUpd` hook and checked
on every request; a password change or reset, enrolling a Second factor, a Second factor reset and
"sign out everywhere" bump it (tokens without an epoch are rejected once); (3) a two-step login:
the direct provider cannot see the request (no IP) or return a "second factor required" outcome,
so a thin handler replaces it, checks the password, answers with a short-lived single-use
challenge, and `/site/auth/second-factor` verifies a TOTP (`pquerna/otp`) or Recovery code before
issuing the cookie. The handler is the `login` operation of the `/site` contract; an ogen handler
has no response writer, so the cookie comes from one issuer (`auth.Sessions`, a go-pkgz token
service) as the operation's declared `Set-Cookie` header, not through `TokenService().Set`. `/auth/` is no longer mounted, so no second path
mints a session around the Second factor. Failed password, Second factor and Recovery code
attempts all feed the existing per-account counter of ADR 0025 (rate limiting): the Login throttle
(GLOSSARY) is that mechanism, not a new one.

## Considered options

- **Hard lock until an admin unlocks (Cal.com, Mailchimp's 24h lock)**: rejected, it lets an
  attacker lock a victim out by failing on purpose.
- **A server-side session table**: rejected, it adds a store lookup and cleanup for a need the
  epoch covers; the User row is already read on every `/w/{slug}` request.
- **Redis or in-memory counters**: rejected, a second datastore for self-hosters, and in-memory
  state is lost across restarts and instances.

## Consequences

- Revocation is all-or-nothing per User; per-device revocation would need a session table later.
- A bump logs out the acting User's other sessions too; the acting session is reissued.
- SMS and trusted-device ("remember me") factors are deliberately absent.
