# One attribute concept: typed Custom fields, auto-created — no schemaless traits

Every Contact attribute beyond the core fields (email / phone / subject_id / name) is a
**Custom field**: a workspace-defined, typed, named definition. There is no second,
schemaless "trait" concept living alongside it. When an unknown key arrives — from Identify or
an Event payload — it is **auto-created** as a Custom field with an inferred type
(declared-by-use), but from that first sight it is a first-class, typed, renameable definition,
not an anonymous key in a bag.

This rejects the usual CDP two-layer shape (Segment, Customer.io): raw schemaless traits
flowing in from `identify`, plus a curated/typed subset "promoted" into custom fields. That
shape reliably rots — hundreds of attributes, half of them near-duplicate typos
(`firstName` / `first_name` / `fname`) — and leaves the Segment builder unable to offer a
trustworthy field list. Collapsing to one governed concept keeps the developer convenience of
schemaless ingest (you don't pre-declare every key) while guaranteeing the builder always has
a real, typed, named field catalogue to target.

## Considered options

- **Two concepts: freeform traits + promoted custom fields.** Rejected: two parallel attribute
  notions for one job, an explicit "promote" step nobody maintains, and an ungoverned trait
  space that the segment builder can't safely surface. (See [[CONTEXT.md]] Anti-vocabulary →
  Trait.)
- **Schema-first: reject unknown keys until declared.** Rejected: breaks the tracker/API
  ingest ergonomics — a customer sending `identify(id, {plan})` would silently lose `plan`
  until an admin declared it. Declared-by-use keeps ingest frictionless.

## Consequences

- Ingest must infer a type on first sight of a key and create the Custom field; later values of
  a conflicting type need a coercion/widening policy (implementation detail, not fixed here).
- Segment rules range over core fields + Custom fields uniformly; there is no "trait vs field"
  distinction to expose in the builder.
- The CDP term "trait" is anti-vocabulary; everything is a Custom field. This composes with
  [[0002-unified-contact-identity]] — one Contact, one attribute model, no CDP-side shadow.
